# 🔐 Angular Security Application

## 🚀 Introduction

This project is a demonstration of implementing security practices in an **Angular** application. The focus is on safeguarding the frontend by controlling access to various components and routes based on user roles and permissions. This project is designed to work in conjunction with a secure backend, such as the Spring Boot application with Spring Security.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🗝️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Roles & Permissions**: Users are assigned roles that dictate their access levels within the application. Each role is associated with specific permissions, allowing or restricting access to certain routes and components.
- **Route Guards**: Angular route guards are utilized to protect routes based on the user’s role, preventing unauthorized access.

### 🧑‍💻 User Authentication
- **JWT Authentication**: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. The JWT is stored in the browser's local storage and is used to verify the user's identity on each request.
- **Login & Logout**: Secure login and logout mechanisms are implemented, ensuring that users can safely access and exit the application.

### 🔒 Component Protection
- **Protected Components**: Certain components are only accessible to users with the appropriate roles. This is enforced by checking the user's permissions before rendering the component.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Content within components can be dynamically rendered based on the user's role, ensuring that users only see what they are authorized to access.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- **src/app**: Contains the main Angular components, services, and modules.
- **auth**: Manages authentication, including login services, JWT handling, and route guards.
- **models**: Defines data models, such as User and Role.
- **services**: Provides services for handling API requests and user authentication.
- **guards**: Implements Angular route guards to protect routes based on roles.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Frontend framework used to build the application.
- **JWT**: Used for secure authentication of users.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language for building Angular components and services.
- **CSS/HTML**: For styling and structuring the application’s user interface.

## 🧩 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BiouiAdnane/AngularSecurity.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd AngularSecurity

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BiouiAdnane/AngularSecurity.git

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ng serve

## 🛡️ Security Configuration
The security is primarily handled using Angular's built-in tools, such as route guards and JWT authentication. Role-based access control is enforced throughout the application, ensuring that users only access the routes and components they are authorized to use.

## 📊 Future Enhancements (Optional)
Consider implementing additional security measures such as:
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security for user login.
  - Enhanced Logging: Tracking user activities for better monitoring and auditing.
  - API Rate Limiting: Preventing abuse by limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a certain timeframe.
